# Overlook


## Abstract

 This project was a solo project during Module 2 at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/).

 Each student was tasked with creating a functioning desktop and mobile friendly website that allows for management and bookings for the hotel. 

 Overlook's project specifications can be found here [project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html)

 Overall, the project was an excellent chance for students to showcase all that they have learned over the previous two innings.

## Learning Goals:

* Build a function application that allows for dynamic login for a user and manager

* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it

* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data

* Ensure our app is following best practices for accessibility

* Detect cross-browser compatibility issues by testing our app on different platforms and environment

* Practice DOM manipulation with jQuery

* Leverage Sass to DRY up our CSS

* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that our DOM manipulation is happening
